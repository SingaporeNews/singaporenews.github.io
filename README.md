## The Singapore News Story 
### (A Data Visualization Project)
=======================

This repository is an entry for the [Data In The City Visualization Challenge](https://ideas.ecitizen.gov.sg/a/pages/visualisationchallenge-home) organized by the Info-communications Development Authority (IDA) of Singapore.

> "The "Data in the City"¬ù Data Visualisation Challenge invites the public to celebrate the 50th anniversary (SG50) 
by telling the Singapore Story using data and visualise how we live, work and play in Singapore. It is an excellent opportunity to commemorate the country's amazing progress and celebrate the best that is yet to come."

The Singapore News Story presents data visualizations of over 50 years of news headlines from Singapore's most prominent daily newspaper The Straits Times. You can see the site at [singaporenews.github.io](singaporenews.github.io). All of the code that collected the data, analyzed and visualized it (in addition to the code for the site itself) is available in this repository. The project is meant to be entirely reproducible and extensible. If you have any questions or if you'd like to contribute, please email Paul (meinshap@gmail.com) or Hanif (hanif.samad.sg@gmail.com).
